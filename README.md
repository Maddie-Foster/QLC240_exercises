# QLC240_exercises Spring 2025- Python Exercises
A repository hosting all exercises completed during QLC 240.

Exercise Descriptions:


Random Number Generator:

This project was designed to create a random number generator to return a number within the range of 0 to 100,000. We had to import packages like "import random."

Random List (Names):

We used a python function to randomize a list of names of people in our class.

Exercise 1:

In this project we imported many packages, including files from google.colab and sklearn.datasets. We also plotted data in several different forms including a histogram, pair plot, box plot, and scatter plot.

Exercise 2:

We imported packages and used python to load a dataframe. We used colab to plot the data as a histogram, a pair plot and a scatter plot. We also used python to edit the graphs and change features such as the title, the legend, the font and axis labels, and plotting only one series.
